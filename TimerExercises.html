1.	What is the difference between the following 2 statements? 
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
This statement will call the booyah function once after 2000ms.

setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
This statement will call the booyah function every 2000ms.

2.	What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) { 
return a * x; 
}; 
var x = myfunc(2, 3); 
var y = myfunc; 
alert(x) = 6
alert(y(2,3)) = 6

3.	Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
function booyah1() {
    alert(“BOOYAH!”);
}
setTimeout(booyah2() {
    alert(“BOOYAH!”); 
}, 2000);


4.	What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
Unobtrusive javascript allows the website to be separated into 3 major categories: HTML, CSS and Javascript. The reason for this I believe is to allow for easy updating and debugging.
